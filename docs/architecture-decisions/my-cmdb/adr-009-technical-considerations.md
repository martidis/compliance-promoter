# ADR 009: Technical considerations

## Decision
Keep things interesting from technologies employed. In general a lot of what we do can be considered an overkill for the purpose of this application. But I wanted to keep things interesting nevertheless.
Things we have in place:
* Monitoring with prometheus and grafana
* Rate limiting
* Caching using hazelcast
* Basic performance tests with jmeter
* Dockerized setup for all the moving parts
* Secured connections from consumers and towards databases
* Plenty more in backlog in case I want to play more with it

## Rationale
* for fun

## Consequences
