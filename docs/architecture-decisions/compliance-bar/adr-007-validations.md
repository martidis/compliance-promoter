# ADR 007: 

## Discussion
There are some requirements we have for new resources we create and for our interactions with the user. Some are really 
required others are artificial to make things interesting (e.g., rate limiting)

## Decision
* All compliance shot items are mandatory
* Title is unique
* Proper values. A url is a url, an email is an email, etc.
* In a minute you can create up to 3 shots, no more
* You need at least one applicable configuration item in order to create a new shot

## Consequences
